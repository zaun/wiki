        "content": "The word 'cocktail' for the alcoholic drink was first recorded in the United States in the early 19th century (1803). The origin of the name itself is highly debated and uncertain, with various theories proposed. Some suggest it refers to the practice of 'cock-tailing' horses, where ginger was placed under the tail to make them spirited, linking to the stimulating effect of the drink. Other theories involve a drink with ingredients 'tailed' like a cock's tail (mixed up colors) or a mispronunciation of a French word like 'coquetel'. The sense of a 'mixture' (Definition 2) is a direct extension of the mixed nature of the drink. The sense of small appetizers (Definition 3) arose in the mid-20th century, likely from their association with cocktail parties."

This term likely originated from a Frankish source, *adubbjan*, which meant 'to strike' or 'to equip'. The historical act of knighting involved a ceremonial striking.\n\n2.  **To replace audio/copy**: This meaning emerged in the early 20th century, largely as a shortening or alteration of the word 'double' or 're-dub'. It refers to the process of duplicating or overlaying sound recordings. The musical genre 'dub' directly stems from this audio-related sense, referring to the practice of remixing existing tracks."

The Latin `agere` is traced back to Proto-Indo-European `*ag-` (meaning 'to drive', 'to draw out or forth', 'to move'). The legal sense of 'to make into law' developed in the early 15th century, while the sense of 'to perform' emerged later."

Latin 'exter' is related to 'ex-' (out of).\nEvolution: The meaning of 'extreme' shifted from denoting a physical outermost point to an utmost degree or intensity. The term 'extremist' then emerged to describe individuals who hold views or advocate actions that are at the furthest limits of what is considered acceptable or moderate."

The French term was formed from 'femme' (woman), from Latin 'femina', combined with the suffix '-iste' (equivalent to English '-ist'), which denotes a person who practices or believes in something. Its adoption into English marked the rise of organized movements advocating for women's rights."

        "content": "The word 'fleet' has dual origins in Old English. As a noun, it comes from Old English 'flēot' meaning 'ship, raft' or 'estuary, inlet', tracing back to Proto-Germanic '*fleutan' (to float, to flow). The sense of 'a group of ships' developed from this. As an adjective, it also originates from Old English 'flēot' meaning 'swift, rapid', which is related to the verb 'flēotan' (to float, to flow, to run quickly), also from Proto-Germanic '*fleutan'. The idea of quick movement is derived from the effortless motion of something floating or flowing."
