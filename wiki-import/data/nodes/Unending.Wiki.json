  "content": "Welcome to the Universal Ontology Project, a comprehensive, hierarchical framework designed to meticulously categorize every conceivable entity—whether abstract, informational, physical, mental, or social—within a logically coherent system. Built upon strict \"is-a-kind-of\" relationships and enriched with optional semantic connections, this ontology aims to provide a deeply structured and semantically rich map of knowledge. From the fundamental axioms of mathematics and the elementary particles of physics to the complexities of human thought and societal structures, each concept is clearly defined and positioned. Explore the interconnectedness of ideas and discover a new way to navigate the vast expanse of knowledge, all organized with formal rigor and designed for both human understanding and machine interpretation.\n",
