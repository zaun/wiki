  "content": "Welcome to the Universal Ontology Project, a hierarchical framework designed to categorize entities. This project aims to organize concepts—whether abstract, informational, physical, mental, or social—within a structured system. It is built upon \"is-a-kind-of\" relationships and may include semantic connections. The ontology intends to provide a structured map of knowledge. From foundational concepts in mathematics and elementary particles in physics to human thought and societal structures, each concept is defined and positioned. This framework seeks to illustrate the relationships between ideas and offers a way to navigate various fields of knowledge, with an emphasis on formal organization for both human comprehension and machine interpretation.",
