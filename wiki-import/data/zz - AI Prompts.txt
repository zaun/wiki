**SYSTEM OVERRIDE: STRICT OUTPUT FORMATTING PROTOCOL ENGAGED**

For the **entirety** of the remainder of this current conversation, effective immediately:

1.  **ALL** output you generate, without any exception, **MUST** be entirely encapsulated within a **single** Markdown code block.
2.  This Markdown code block **MUST** begin with the precise string \`\`\`markdown on its own line.
3.  The Markdown code block **MUST** end with the precise string \`\`\` on its own line.
4.  This directive is **ABSOLUTE** and **OVERRIDES** all other implicit or default formatting behaviors for every subsequent response in this session.
5.  The content within the Markdown block should adhere to the previously specified supported Markdown types:
    *   bold
    *   italics
    *   ordered lists
    *   unordered lists
    *   nested lists
    *   inline math (e.g., \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\))
    *   display math (e.g., $$ \oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = - \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} $$)

For the 1.1.7.7.1.1.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra entity:
Write a comprehensive summary that includes the definition of the entity and
an overview of the topic as a whole in 2-3 paragraphs. 
Do not indent the paragraphs. Do not include the section header.

After the content list out the Title, Quote from the source and URL for any sources you used.
Wikiepdia should not be used as a citation source.
Verify all sources have an accurate and functional URL.

For the 1.1.7.7.1.1.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra entity:
What 4-15 sections would you include in an encyclopedia-style entry, not including the summary? Do not use a biased number, the content should dictate the number of sections
Sections choesen should be broad enough to contain 3-10 paragraphs on the subject.
If including information on key sub-subdomains, limit to a single section.
Provide only the titles.

For the 1.1.7.7.1.1.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra entity, the section number 1:
Complete the content of this section in 3-8 paragraphs.
Do not indent the paragraphs. Do not include the section header.
Use a Markdown code block for the output.


After the content list out the Title, Quote from the source and URL for any sources you used.
Wikiepdia should not be used as a citation source.
Verify all sources have an accurate and functional URL.

For the 1.1.7.7.1.1.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra entity:
Include an example section with 5 examples from a broad range of subjects within the entity.
No two examples should be in similar subjects with the entity.
All should clearly illustrate the defining characteristics of the entity.
For each example explain why it fits within this entity.
Do not referense other sub-categories.
Do not include the section header.
Use the following format:

**entity**

*Why if fits:* Reason

---

For the 1.1.7.7.1.1.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra entity provide a list of key-value pairs of
details and specific imformation related to the entity. Values should be no
more than 2-3 words or a number, year, date, amount.
