    "content": "A Channel ADT represents a first‑class conduit for passing messages or data items between concurrent participants. By decoupling senders and receivers, channels provide synchronization, buffering, and ordering semantics—enabling pipelines, event streams, and communication patterns without exposing low‑level locking or memory details.",

            "content": "Unbuffered (synchronous) channels block the sender until a receiver is ready, enforcing rendezvous communication. Buffered (asynchronous) channels provide a finite-capacity queue: sends proceed until the buffer is full, and receives block when it is empty, decoupling timing between producers and consumers."

Unbuffered channels may use handoff protocols, while buffered channels implement circular buffers with head/tail indices and backpressure support."

Higher‑level constructs—select (CSP ALT, Go select), multiplexing, and timeouts—allow coordination across multiple channels."
