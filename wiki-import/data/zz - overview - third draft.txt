I've been building a formal, hierarchical ontology designed to categorize everything—real or imagined—within a logically complete system. Here's a description of my ontology project so far:

Overview
The ontology serves as a universal classification framework capable of organizing all known and potential entities. It is structured as a multi-level hierarchy, with no arbitrary limits on depth or breadth—only what is logically necessary to fully encompass each category. The top levels divide reality into broad domains, and each subsequent level breaks these down into more specific and meaningful subcategories. Every node includes a title, summary, and detailed sections to describe the category in full.

Top-Level Categories
I've defined these top-level domains, each representing a fundamental kind of entity or concept:

Abstract – Pure abstractions not dependent on physical instantiation, such as logic, numbers, or mathematical structures.
Informational – The domain of Information, encompassing its fundamental forms, physical manifestations, properties, processes, and characteristics.
Physical – The fundamental domain of tangible reality and its characteristics within space-time.
Mental – The realm of mind, encompassing consciousness, cognition, affect, and volition.
Social – The domain encompassing collective entities, structures, processes, and forms arising from the interaction of conscious agents.
Meta – The processes, methods, models, and formal languages used for constructing or analyzing entities in other categories.

Key Characteristics
Promary relationship between parent anch child nodes is "is-a-kind-of". No node can exist within the hiearchy without this primary relatship.
Deeply Nested: Categories go at least six levels deep, with branches continuing as needed to remain semantically distinct.
No “Other” Buckets: You explicitly reject catch-all categories; every concept must have a logically valid place.
Complete Definitions: Each node (category) includes a full description and sections independent of its children.
Semantic Search and Classification: I am building or planning support tools (e.g. WordNet, ConceptNet) to aid in placing new entities based on meaning, not just keywords.

Primary Hierarchical Relationship (is-a-kind-of):
The fundamental parent-child structure (indicated by indentation and numbering) in this ontology represents the "is-a-kind-of" relationship. For any child node \(C\) directly under a parent node \(P\), it means that \(C\) is a specific type or subtype of \(P\). Consequently, any instance or conceptual element belonging to category \(C\) also belongs to category \(P\), and inherits all characteristics and properties defined for \(P\).

Relationships
In addition to the overall parent relationship each entity has, there are several optional relationships that can exist. These are for added clarity and informational purposes, not changing where an entity "lives" in the heiarcy.
1. DEPENDS_ON: Logical, structural, or functional dependency.
Forward (A → B): A depends on B
Reverse (B ← A): B is a dependency of A
2. CONTRASTS_WITH: Distinction or meaningful inverse; not mutually exclusive, but defining by opposition.
Forward (A → B): A contrasts with B
Reverse (B → A): B contrasts with A
3. CONTAINS: Whole to part — good if you want the direction to flow from parent to child.
Forward (A → B): A contains B
Reverse (B ← A): B is contained in A
4. INVALIDATES: One concept undermines, falsifies, or renders another obsolete.
Forward (A → B): A invalidates B
Reverse (B ← A): B is invalidated by A

Abstract Summary:
The Abstract category encompasses all entities that do not possess physical form or spatial–temporal extension but exist as conceptual, formal, or ideal objects. These include mathematical entities (such as numbers and sets), logical constructs (like propositions and proofs), algorithms, and other framework elements that underpin formal reasoning. While they lack material substance, abstract entities provide the structural backbone for mathematics, logic, computer science, and the formal sciences.\n\nAbstract entities are contrasted with concrete or physical entities in that they are not located in space or time; they do not have mass, energy, or causal efficacy in the physical world. Instead, they are instantiated or represented by physical tokens—such as written symbols, software code, or neural encodings—but are not reducible to them. Their ontological status has long been debated in philosophy, with positions ranging from Platonism (which treats them as timeless, non-spatial realities) to nominalism (which regards them as conceptual or linguistic conventions).\n\nDespite their intangibility, abstract entities are indispensable. They allow us to generalize patterns, formulate theories, construct formal systems, and communicate rigorously. Because they can be manipulated without reference to empirical constraints, they serve as a universal substrate for modeling, simulation, and symbolic reasoning.

Imformational Summary: (out of date based on the udpated definition)
Information encompasses the patterns, structures, and symbols that reduce uncertainty and convey meaning across natural and artificial systems. It is instantiated wherever a distinguishable difference or arrangement can be interpreted by an observer or process—from the genetic sequences in living cells to the binary streams powering digital networks. At its core, information serves as the bridge between raw data and contextual understanding, acting as the fundamental currency of communication, computation, and knowledge.\n\nAcross biological and technological realms, informational processes govern replication, storage, processing, and transmission. Genetic codes carry hereditary instructions in organisms, while digital protocols encode multimedia for global distribution. These processes rely on systematic rules for encoding and decoding, ensuring that meaning travels intact across space and time. By abstracting away from specific media, the informational category unifies disparate phenomena under the shared principle of meaningful pattern exchange.\n\nThe study of information draws on diverse disciplines—mathematics, computer science, linguistics, biology, and philosophy—to explore how information is represented, manipulated, and interpreted. Information theory formalizes the quantification of uncertainty and channel capacity; cognitive science examines how minds process symbols; and communication engineering designs robust channels for signal integrity. Together, these perspectives reveal the pervasive role of information in shaping reality and driving innovation.

Mental Summary: (out of date based on the udpated definition)
The mental encompasses all subjective or experiential phenomena associated with conscious agents—processes such as thinking, perceiving, imagining, feeling, and intending that occur within the mind. Mental states are inherently subjective, accessible only to the agent experiencing them, and include thoughts, emotions, memories, and sensory experiences. By focusing on representational content and qualitative character, the mental describes how individuals internally process information, make sense of the world, and engage in complex behavior. Although mental phenomena are grounded in neural and physiological mechanisms of the brain, the mental level of description highlights the first‑person perspective—the “what it is like” aspect of experience that distinguishes mental life from purely physical events. Understanding the mental requires integrating insights from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science to explain how subjective experience emerges, how it can be measured, and how it impacts individual lives, social interactions, and broader societal structures.

Physical Summary: (out of date based on the udpated definition)
The concept of the “physical” designates all that is materially real—entities and phenomena that occupy regions of space, persist through time, and exhibit properties amenable to observation or measurement. Physical things range from everyday objects like rocks and living organisms to fields such as light and magnetism, all governed by consistent natural laws. What unites these diverse manifestations is their tangibility in spacetime: they have location and duration, interact through forces, and yield quantifiable attributes such as mass, charge, and energy. By contrast, abstract constructs—mathematical objects or purely conceptual frameworks—do not themselves occupy space or have duration outside of thought. Thus, to say something is physical is to assert it is part of the material universe, open to empirical investigation and governed by the regularities we codify as the laws of physics.

Social Sumary: (out of date based on the udpated definition)
Social phenomena encompass the myriad structures, processes, and patterns that emerge from interactions among conscious agents. At its core, the social domain bridges individual actions and collective realities, giving rise to institutions—such as families, governments, and markets—and informal arrangements like norms, traditions, and networks. These phenomena are neither reducible to isolated individuals nor entirely predetermined by overarching systems; rather, they arise in the interplay between human agency and structural constraints.\n\nThe study of the social realm is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, political science, and philosophy. Through diverse lenses, scholars examine how values, beliefs, and power dynamics shape group behavior and collective decision-making. Social processes unfold across multiple scales, from intimate dyads and small communities to nation-states and global networks, each level exhibiting its own patterns of cohesion, conflict, and change.\n\nSocial life is dynamic and continually evolving. Technological innovations, demographic shifts, economic transformations, and ideological movements all contribute to the ongoing reconfiguration of social orders. Understanding social phenomena is essential for navigating contemporary challenges—such as inequality, migration, and digital connectivity—and for designing institutions and policies that foster cooperation, justice, and resilience.

Meta Summary: (out of date based on the udpated definition)
The concept of “meta” refers to a higher-order layer of abstraction that describes, analyzes, or governs other entities, systems, or phenomena. At its core, meta involves frameworks, models, or representations that stand apart from—and provide insight into—the very subjects they reference. Whether in philosophy, computing, data management, or organizational theory, meta constructs enable reflexivity: thinking about thinking, modeling models, and categorizing categories.\n\nBy externalizing relations and structures into distinct artifacts—such as metadata schemas, metamodels, or meta-theoretical critiques—meta approaches facilitate clarity, interoperability, and methodological rigor. These second-order constructs serve as lenses through which we understand the assumptions, boundaries, and internal dynamics of primary systems. As disciplines increasingly converge in their reliance on complex data and layered abstraction, meta perspectives have become indispensable tools for both theoretical inquiry and practical implementation.

Future: Leverage Existing Knowledge Structures (Carefully): When expanding (e.g., biological taxonomy, chemical classifications, psychological terms, legal codes), carefully evaluate existing structures and adapt them to fit your strict "is-a-kind-of" rule and definitions. Don't just import them blindly.
