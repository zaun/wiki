# OmniOntos: The Structured Encyclopedia (General Overview)

**Imagine Wikipedia, but perfectly organized. Every article has its logical place, and you can navigate from the biggest ideas down to the smallest details without getting lost.**

## What Is OmniOntos?

OmniOntos is a new kind of encyclopedia where **every topic is an article** and **every article knows exactly where it belongs**. Unlike traditional encyclopedias or Wikipedia, you can start with any big topic and drill down through logical layers to find exactly the level of detail you need.

**Think of it like this:**
- **Top Level:** "Transportation" ‚Üí A broad overview of how humans and goods move around
- **Middle Level:** "Electric Vehicles" ‚Üí Focused article on EV technology, history, and impact  
- **Deep Level:** "Tesla Model 3 Battery System" ‚Üí Technical specifications and engineering details

Each article inherits context from the ones above it, so you always understand how your topic fits into the bigger picture.

## The Six Domains: How We Organize Everything

Instead of random alphabetical ordering, OmniOntos organizes all knowledge into six fundamental areas:

### üî¢ **Abstract** - Pure Ideas & Logic
Mathematics, logic, theoretical concepts that exist in thought alone
*Examples: Numbers, geometric theorems, algorithms, game theory*

### üìä **Informational** - Data, Patterns & Communication  
Information itself - how it's structured, transmitted, and processed
*Examples: Languages, file formats, communication protocols, data structures*

### üåç **Physical** - The Material World
Everything you can touch, see, or measure in the physical universe
*Examples: Planets, animals, chemicals, machines, energy, forces*

### üß† **Mental** - Mind & Consciousness
Individual thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and mental processes
*Examples: Emotions, memory, perception, decision-making, consciousness*

### üë• **Social** - People & Relationships
How humans interact, organize, and create culture together
*Examples: Governments, companies, religions, cultures, economies, families*

### üîß **Meta** - Methods & Tools
The techniques and frameworks we use to study and understand everything else
*Examples: Scientific method, research techniques, measurement tools, analysis methods*

## How It Works

### **Perfect Navigation**
- Start broad, get specific - or jump directly to what you need
- Never lose context - each article connects logically to related topics
- No more "Wikipedia rabbit holes" - stay focused or explore systematically

### **Rich Content**
- Every topic gets a full encyclopedia-style article
- Multiple sections for different aspects (history, applications, technical details)
- Structured data alongside readable text

### **Smart Connections** 
- Articles link to related topics across different domains
- See dependencies, contrasts, and relationships
- Discover relevant information you didn't know you needed

## Why This Matters

**For Students:** Learn any subject with perfect context and logical progression

**For Researchers:** Quickly understand new fields and find relevant connections

**For Professionals:** Access both overview understanding and technical depth

**For Everyone:** Finally, an encyclopedia that makes sense instead of overwhelming you

## Key Principles

- **One Right Place:** Every topic has exactly one primary location (no duplicates or confusion)
- **Unlimited Depth:** Go as detailed as you need - from overview to expert level
- **No Junk Drawers:** No "miscellaneous" or "other" categories - everything has a logical home
- **Community Built:** Like Wikipedia, but with better organization and quality control
