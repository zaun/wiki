I've been building a formal, hierarchical ontology designed to categorize everything—real or imagined—within a logically complete system. Here's a description of my ontology project so far:

Overview
--------
The ontology serves as a universal classification framework capable of organizing all known and potential entities. It is structured as a multi-level hierarchy, with no arbitrary limits on depth or breadth—only what is logically necessary to fully encompass each category. The top levels divide reality into broad domains, and each subsequent level breaks these down into more specific and meaningful subcategories. Every node includes a title, summary, and detailed sections to describe the category in full.

Top-Level Categories (final)
----------------------------
1. Abstract: The domain encompassing pure abstractions not dependent on physical, mental, or social instantiation. This includes formal systems (such as logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science constructs like algorithms as abstract procedures), conceptual entities defined by axioms or universal properties (like numbers, sets, categories, topological spaces defined by their properties), and theoretical structures whose existence is solely in the conceptual or formal realm. The focus is on entities and concepts defined by formal rules, logical relations, or abstract properties, existing outside of space-time and causal physical interaction. It is distinct from the information content of instantiated forms (Informational), the subjective mental experience of abstractions (Mental), and the social conventions or institutions that might discuss, develop, or use them (Social).
2. Informational: The domain encompassing information as abstract patterns, structures, representations, and meanings, independent of their specific physical carriers or instantiations. This includes fundamental forms, properties, logical structures, processes of transformation and analysis, and abstract characteristics of information content and representation itself. The focus is on the form, content, encoding, decoding, transmission rules, and interpretation of information, rather than the physical medium or energy used to embody or transmit it.
3. Physical: The fundamental domain of tangible reality and its intrinsic characteristics within space-time. This domain encompasses entities that possess mass, energy, occupy space, and persist through time, as well as the forces, fields, properties, states, structures, and dynamics intrinsic to such physical existence. The focus is on the material instantiation and physical behavior of phenomena and entities within the physical universe, distinct from any information or abstract structure they may carry or represent.
4. Mental: The domain encompassing the subjective, experiential, and internal states, processes, content, and capacities associated with individual conscious agents. This includes consciousness itself, affective states (emotions, moods, feelings), sensory experiences (perceptions, raw qualia), cognitive processes (perception, attention, memory, thinking, reasoning, learning, imagination), volitional processes (motivation, decision-making, intention, self-control), and mental content (beliefs, desires, subjective representations, concepts as mentally held). The focus is on the first-person perspective and the phenomena that constitute inner mental life and individual subjective experience. It is distinct from the physical substrate (e.g., brain, neural activity), the abstract informational structures processed (Informational), and the collective or emergent properties of interacting minds (which belong to the Social domain).
5. Social: The domain encompassing the entities, structures, processes, forms, and emergent phenomena arising from the interaction, relationship, and organization of multiple conscious agents. This includes collective entities (such as dyads, groups, communities, formal organizations, populations), patterned relationships (social networks, hierarchies, statuses, roles), enduring frameworks (institutions like family, economy, polity, law, education, religion; shared culture including norms, values, beliefs, customs, symbolic systems), dynamic interactions (communication, cooperation, competition, conflict, collective action, influence), and integrated collective arrangements (socio-technical systems, economic systems, political systems). The focus is on the collective level of reality, generated by intersubjectivity, interdependence, and coordination among agents. It is distinct from individual mental states (Mental), the physical properties of the agents or their environment (Physical), the abstract information exchanged during interaction (Informational), and the methodologies used to analyze social phenomena (Meta).
6. Meta: The domain encompassing the higher-order concepts, formal languages, methods, processes, models, and frameworks used for constructing, analyzing, managing, evaluating, or understanding entities, systems, or concepts within any other domain. This includes methodologies for inquiry and practice (like the scientific method, engineering processes, research methodologies), formal techniques for specification, verification, and reasoning (formal methods, logic systems applied to other domains), meta-modeling approaches, knowledge organization methods (ontology building, schema design, classification processes), evaluation criteria and techniques (benchmarking, validation), and frameworks for designing or governing complex systems (meta-policies, governance models). The focus is on the tools, processes, and conceptual structures used to operate on or reason about other domains, serving a meta-level or reflective function. It is distinct from the primary subject matter or entities being studied, modeled, or managed. Applied fields (like Medicine, Engineering, Education, Law as practice) are areas that utilize concepts and methods from the Meta domain (among others) but are not themselves kinds of Meta entities; they are complex domains of activity that draw upon multiple fundamental categories.

Key Characteristics of the Ontology
-----------------------------------
Primary Hierarchical Relationship: The fundamental structural relationship between a parent node and its child nodes is strictly defined as subsumption, represented as "is-a-kind-of". Each node within the ontology hierarchy must participate in this primary subsumption relationship, forming a single inheritance structure.
Hierarchical Depth and Granularity: The ontology is structured to support considerable hierarchical depth, extending to a minimum of six levels. Further branching is pursued as required to maintain clear semantic distinctions between categories and ensure exhaustive coverage within defined domains.
Constraint Against Miscellaneous Categories: The incorporation of "catch-all" or miscellaneous categories (e.g., "Other", "Unclassified") is explicitly disallowed. This principle necessitates that every concept positioned within the ontology must possess a logically valid and specifically defined placement.
Node Definition Completeness: Each node, representing a specific category, is associated with a comprehensive definition and additional descriptive sections. These specifications are formulated to be complete in themselves, independent of the definitions provided for the node's direct child categories.
Semantic-Enabled Classification: Support mechanisms for semantic search and automated classification are planned or under development. By integrating with or referencing external knowledge resources (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet), the system aims to facilitate the accurate placement of new entities within the hierarchy based on their intrinsic meaning, rather than solely on keyword matching.

Primary Hierarchical Relationship (is-a-kind-of)
------------------------------------------------
The foundational structure of this ontology is a strict, tree-like hierarchy. The relationship between any parent node (P) and its direct child node (C) is exclusively that of subsumption, formally defined as "is-a-kind-of". This relationship is visually represented and identified by the systematic indentation and numbering of nodes within the hierarchy. For this to hold:

Any entity or conceptual element classified under category (C) is necessarily also an instance of category (P).
Category (C) represents a more specific type or subtype of the broader category (P).
Consequently, any characteristics, properties, or definitions ascribed to node (P) are inherited by its child node (C) and all subsequent descendants in that branch.
This "is-a-kind-of" relationship is the sole determinant of a node's position within the primary hierarchical structure.
No node can exist within the hierarchy without being connected to a parent node via this primary "is-a-kind-of" relationship (except for the top-level root nodes).

Relationships (Optional)
------------------------
In addition to the mandatory primary hierarchical (is-a-kind-of) relationship, the ontology permits the definition of several optional, directed relationships between any two nodes. These relationships serve to capture more complex connections, dependencies, or oppositions that cannot be represented by the hierarchical structure alone. They enrich the semantic network of the ontology by linking nodes across different branches or within the same branch in ways other than subsumption. Crucially, establishing these optional relationships does not alter a node's primary classification or its position within the "is-a-kind-of" hierarchy.
DEPENDS_ON: Represents a logical, structural, or functional dependency between entities.
    DEPENDS_ON (A → B): Entity A's existence, validity, or functioning is contingent upon entity B. (e.g., A Theorem DEPENDS_ON its Axioms)
    DEPENDS_ON (B ← A): Entity B is a dependency required by entity A.
CONTRASTS_WITH: Indicates a significant conceptual distinction or opposition between two entities, often used to define concepts by highlighting their differences. These entities are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
    CONTRASTS_WITH (A → B): Entity A stands in meaningful contrast to entity B. (e.g., Light CONTRASTS_WITH Darkness)
    CONTRASTS_WITH (B → A): Entity B stands in meaningful contrast to entity A.
CONTAINS: Specifies a whole-to-part or compositional relationship, where one entity is a constituent component or part of another. This relationship is a separate link between nodes and is distinct from the primary hierarchical (is-a-kind-of) structure.
    CONTAINS (A → B): Entity A is composed of or includes Entity B as a part. (e.g., A Building CONTAINS a Room)
    CONTAINS (B ← A): Entity B is a part of or contained within Entity A.
INVALIDATES: Represents a relationship where one concept, finding, or entity undermines, falsifies, or renders another obsolete, typically due to new evidence, theoretical advancement, or logical inconsistency.
    INVALIDATES (A → B): Entity A demonstrates the invalidity or obsolescence of Entity B. (e.g., General Relativity INVALIDATES Newtonian Gravity at high speeds/strong fields)
    INVALIDATES (B ← A): Entity B is demonstrated to be invalid or obsolete by Entity A.


Notes
-----
Leverage Existing Knowledge Structures (Carefully): When expanding (e.g., biological taxonomy, chemical classifications, psychological terms, legal codes), carefully evaluate existing structures and adapt them to fit your strict "is-a-kind-of" rule and definitions. Don't just import them blindly.
