  "content": "Complexity classes categorize decision problems and computational tasks by the asymptotic resources—time, space, randomness, or circuit size—required on idealized machine models. By abstracting away hardware specifics, they delineate which problems are feasibly solvable, which require superpolynomial resources, and which are inherently intractable. This classification underpins theoretical computer science, guiding algorithm design, cryptographic security assumptions, and our understanding of the limits of computation.",

      "title": "Measuring Computation: Models and Resources",
      "content": "Complexity theory abstracts computation to idealized models—deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines, random‑access machines, and Boolean circuits. Resources include **time** (number of steps as a function of input size), **space** (memory cells or tape cells), **randomness** (coin flips), and **circuit complexity** (size and depth of Boolean circuits). Uniformity conditions distinguish algorithmic (uniform) from circuit (non‑uniform) classes, while oracle models and alternation add further dimensions."

      "content": "Fundamental classes frame our view of tractability:\n\n- **P**: Deterministic polynomial time—problems solvable in time O(n^k).\n- **NP**: Nondeterministic polynomial time—solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\n- **co‑NP**: Complements of NP problems.\n- **L** and **NL**: Deterministic and nondeterministic logarithmic space.\n- **PSPACE**: Polynomial space, regardless of time.\n- **EXP**: Deterministic exponential time.\n\nThese classes form the backbone of the complexity landscape with inclusions P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXP."

      "title": "Reductions and Complete Problems",
      "content": "Completeness arises via resource‑bounded reductions that transform instances of one problem into another. **Polynomial‑time many‑one reductions** define NP‑completeness: a problem in NP is NP‑complete if every NP problem reduces to it (e.g., SAT, Clique, 3‑Coloring). Similarly, **PSPACE‑complete** problems like QBF capture the hardest problems in polynomial space. Complete problems serve as benchmarks for intractability and guide algorithmic and hardness analyses."

      "title": "Hierarchy Theorems and Separation Results",
      "content": "Hierarchy theorems guarantee strictly greater power with more resources: the **Time Hierarchy Theorem** and **Space Hierarchy Theorem** show that DTIME(f(n)) ⊊ DTIME(cf(n) log f(n)) and DSPACE(s(n)) ⊊ DSPACE(cs(n)), for constructible bounds. **Savitch’s Theorem** bridges nondeterministic and deterministic space, and **Immerman–Szelepcsényi** yields NL = co‑NL. Many class separations—most famously P vs NP—remain open, driving deep research."
