            "title": "Definition and Scope",
            "content": "Interpretation refers to assigning meaning or context to informational inputs, while processing denotes the systematic transformation of data through algorithmic, statistical, or logical operations. Together, they form the bridge between unstructured signals and structured knowledge, enabling both humans and machines to act on information."

            "content": "In cognitive science, information processing models describe mental operations—perception, attention, memory, and reasoning—that convert sensory stimuli into internal representations. Frameworks such as the information‑processing paradigm liken the mind to a serial or parallel processor, integrating bottom‑up sensory data with top‑down expectations to interpret experience."

            "content": "Automated information processing relies on computational pipelines: data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Algorithms—sorting, clustering, classification, and regression—operate on structured or unstructured inputs to detect patterns, predict outcomes, and optimize decisions. Scalability and efficiency hinge on parallelization, indexing, and distributed architectures."

Tasks include tokenization, parsing, semantic role labeling, and entity recognition. Semantic processing maps language to formal representations (ontologies, knowledge graphs), supporting question answering, translation, and summarization."

Techniques such as Fourier analysis, wavelet transforms, and convolutional filtering enable noise reduction, pattern detection, and efficient encoding for storage and transmission."

Knowledge extraction combines pattern mining, rule learning, and graph analysis to identify relationships and generate explanations. Feedback loops refine processing based on outcomes and evolving requirements."
