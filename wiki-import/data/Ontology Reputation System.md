## System Overview

OmniOntos uses a **dual reputation system** combining site-wide community trust with domain-specific expertise. This prevents inappropriate cross-domain authority while encouraging quality contributions and community participation.

### Core Philosophy
- **Site-Wide Reputation:** Measures general trustworthiness, editorial skills, and community participation
- **Domain Reputation:** Measures specific expertise within individual knowledge domains
- **Both Required:** High-level permissions require both community trust AND domain expertise

---

## Core Concepts

### Reputation Types

#### Site-Wide Reputation
- Single score across entire platform
- Earned through community participation, quality editing, moderation
- Determines basic platform privileges and cross-domain capabilities
- Range: 0 to unlimited

#### Domain Reputation
- Separate score for each of the 6 domains (Abstract, Informational, Physical, Mental, Social, Meta)
- Earned through domain-specific contributions and expertise verification
- Determines content editing authority within specific domains
- Range: 0 to unlimited per domain

### Permission Logic
**Final Permission = Site-Wide Role âˆ© Domain Authority**

A user needs BOTH sufficient site-wide reputation for their role AND sufficient domain reputation for domain-specific actions.
